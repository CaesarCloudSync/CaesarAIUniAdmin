K23: Principles of a range of development methods and approaches and the contexts in which they can be applied


Examples of Development Methods and Approaches


Scrum




An agile development framework that emphasizes collaboration, iteration, and flexibility.


Key principles:


Sprints: Short, focused work cycles typically lasting 1-4 weeks.


Product backlog: A prioritized list of features to be developed.


Daily stand-up meetings: Brief team meetings to track progress and identify obstacles.








Extreme Programming (XP)




Another agile methodology that prioritizes customer satisfaction and rapid feedback.


Key practices:


Continuous integration: Regularly merging changes into the main codebase.


Pair programming: Two developers working together on the same task.


Test-driven development (TDD): Writing automated tests before implementing code.








Waterfall




A sequential development approach that follows a linear progression of phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment.


Best suited for projects with well-defined requirements and limited scope for change.




Prince2




A project management methodology that focuses on structured planning, controlled execution, and risk management.


Key principles:


Work breakdown structure: A hierarchical decomposition of project tasks.


Timelines and budgets: Detailed plans for task scheduling and resource allocation.

How I Actioned Tasks




Planned and prioritized sprints using agile tools:
 Created product backlogs and organized sprint planning meetings to define and prioritize features.


Facilitated daily stand-up meetings:
 Led team discussions to track progress, identify blockers, and make adjustments as needed.


Implemented continuous integration:
 Set up a pipeline in Jenkins to automatically merge changes and run automated tests.


Followed Prince2 principles for project management:
 Developed work breakdown structures and timelines to ensure structured planning and execution.
