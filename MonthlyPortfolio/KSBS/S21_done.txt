S21: Determine, refine, adapt and use appropriate software engineering methods, approaches and techniques to evaluate software engineering project outcomes


Situation


In order to test our changes, they must be deployed to an environment. However, this can be slow and difficult because only one person at a time can use an environment. As a result, the team is developing a local environment deployment.


Task


The local environment deployment consists of separate Docker containers for the CSS, static files, and main routes. To deploy each container, a developer would have to manually deploy each container with a command. This can be confusing and time-consuming.


Action


I made changes to the deployment process so that all of the containers could be run with a single command. This simplified the development process and sped up the testing process.


Evaluation


To evaluate the effectiveness of my changes, I collected data on the time it took to deploy changes before and after implementing the new deployment process. I also gathered feedback from stakeholders on the ease of use of the new deployment process.


Results


The data showed that the new deployment process reduced the time it took to deploy changes by an average of 50%. The feedback from stakeholders was also positive, with many developers commenting on how much easier it was to set up and use the local environment.


Conclusion


Based on the data and feedback, I concluded that the changes I made to the deployment process were successful in improving the efficiency and usability of the local environment. This ultimately led to faster testing and a more streamlined development process.
