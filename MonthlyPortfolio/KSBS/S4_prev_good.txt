Evidence: S4: Initiate, design, code, test and debug a software component for a digital and technology solution.


May 2024


Situation


I joined a new project involving a large and complex software system with multiple components and teams. The project used various DevOps tools, including BitBucket for repository management and Jira for issue tracking and environment management.


Task


My first task was to make simple changes to the system, which involved transferring SQL commands from one file to another. To identify the commands quickly, I created a small script. After making the changes, I needed to follow a specific process to push, test, and merge my changes into the master branch. This process involved rebasing, pushing, and resolving merge conflicts.

Action


Before making any changes, I performed a 
git pull
 and 
git rebase
 to update my local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository. I encountered merge conflicts, which I resolved using the merge editor.

I then rebased my changes, pushed them to the remote repository, and created a tester tag. The tester used this tag to deploy my changes to a test environment and run regression tests. Jenkins was used to track the build status.

Result


When my changes were ready for review, I created a pull request (PR). Three PR reviewers reviewed the code, and once approved, it was merged during a merge slot.


Debugging


During the development process, I encountered several errors. I used a combination of tools and techniques to debug and fix the errors, including:




Logging:
 I added logging statements to identify the source of the errors.


Debugging tools:
 I used debugging tools such as 
pdb
 and 
ipdb
 to step through the code and inspect the values of variables.


Code reviews:
 I sought feedback from colleagues and participated in code reviews to identify and fix errors.




By following these steps, I was able to successfully initiate, design, code, test, and debug a software component for a digital and technology solution.
