Evidence: B2: Reliable, objective and capable of both independent and team working.


March 2024


Situation


I worked with a colleague to produce summary reports for BAU. However, there were some gaps in the reports that needed to be filled in.


Task


Since my colleague was unavailable, I needed to independently fill in the gaps in the reports.


Action


To ensure that I could complete the task independently, I:




Reviewed previous examples:
 I examined previous summary reports to understand the format and content required.


Consulted with stakeholders:
 I scheduled a meeting with a stakeholder to clarify any uncertainties or missing information.

Filled in the gaps:
 I used the information gathered from the stakeholder meeting and maturity assessment to fill in the gaps in the summary reports.




Result


I successfully filled in the gaps in the summary reports independently. The completed reports were then shared with the rest of the team and stakeholders.


Benefits of independent working




Increased efficiency:
 Independent working allowed me to complete the task without relying on others, which saved time.


Improved problem-solving skills:
 By working independently, I had to identify and solve problems on my own, which improved my problem-solving abilities.


Enhanced self-reliance:
 Completing the task independently boosted my self-confidence and made me more self-reliant.
