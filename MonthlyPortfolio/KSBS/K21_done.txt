Situation


When starting work on an issue, we are assigned a ticket in Jira. During our daily startup meeting, we provide updates on the progress of our tickets.


Task


My task was to analyze the requirements of the assigned ticket and determine the necessary steps to complete it.


Action


Requirements analysis


I reviewed the ticket description and any associated documents to understand the requirements of the change.
