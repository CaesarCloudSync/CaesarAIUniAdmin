Lecture 3 

Modelling and Analysing the Internal Working of a Business System and Process



Business System:
 A set of interrelated processes that work together to achieve a common goal.


Process Model:
 A representation of a process that shows its inputs, outputs, activities, and flow of control.


Process Analysis:
 The examination of a process to identify areas for improvement.


Modelling Techniques:
 Tools and methods used to create process models, such as flowcharts and BPMN diagrams.


Analysis Techniques:
 Methods used to evaluate process performance and identify improvement opportunities, such as value stream mapping and process simulation.




Importance of Modelling and Analysing Business Systems and Processes:




- Provides a clear understanding of how a business operates. 
- Facilitates process improvement and optimization.
- Supports decision-making and strategic planning.
- Enhances communication and collaboration.




Modelling and Analysing the Internal Working of a Business System and Process



Flowcharts:
 Diagrams that use symbols to represent process steps and their relationships.


BPMN Diagrams:
 Standardized diagrams that use specific shapes and connectors to represent process elements.




Process models provide a clear understanding of how processes work, facilitating communication and collaboration among stakeholders.


Process Analysis


Process analysis involves examining a process to identify areas for improvement. Common analysis techniques include:




Value Stream Mapping:
 A tool that visually represents the flow of materials and information through a process, identifying non-value-added activities.


Process Simulation:
 A technique that uses computer models to simulate process behavior, allowing for the evaluation of different scenarios and improvement options.




Process analysis helps to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.


Importance of Modelling and Analysing Business Systems and Processes


Modelling and analysing business systems and processes is important for several reasons:





Process Improvement:
 Process analysis helps to identify areas for improvement, leading to increased efficiency and effectiveness.


Decision-Making:
 Process models and analysis support decision-making by providing insights into process performance and potential improvement options.


Strategic Planning:
 By understanding the internal workings of a business, organizations can develop more effective strategic plans.




Conclusion


Modelling and analysing business systems and processes is a powerful tool for understanding how an organization operates and identifying areas for improvement. Process models provide a visual representation of processes, while process analysis techniques allow for their evaluation and optimization. By embracing these techniques, organizations can gain a competitive advantage by improving their processes, making better decisions, and achieving strategic objectives.
