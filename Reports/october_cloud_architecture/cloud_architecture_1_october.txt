Lecture: NIST Cloud Computing Characteristics and How They Are Involved



NIST:
 National Institute of Standards and Technology


Cloud Computing:
 A model for delivering IT services over the internet.


NIST Cloud Computing Characteristics:
 On-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, measured service.




How NIST Involves These Characteristics for Cloud Computing:




On-demand self-service:
 Users can provision and manage cloud resources without human interaction.

 Cloud providers offer self-service portals and APIs, allowing users to provision and manage resources without waiting for IT support.


Broad network access:
 Cloud services are accessible over the internet from anywhere.
 Cloud services are hosted on the internet, making them accessible from any device with an internet connection, regardless of location.

Resource pooling:
 Cloud resources are pooled to serve multiple users, providing economies of scale.
 Cloud providers pool resources across multiple users, enabling efficient utilization and cost savings.


Rapid elasticity:
 Cloud resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet changing demand.
 Cloud resources can be scaled up or down in minutes, providing flexibility to meet fluctuating demand and avoid over-provisioning.

Measured service:
 Cloud usage is monitored and measured, providing transparency and accountability.
 Cloud providers monitor and measure resource usage, providing detailed billing and enabling users to track and optimize their consumption.



Conclusion


The NIST cloud computing characteristics are essential elements of the cloud computing model. They provide on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service, enabling users to access and manage computing resources in a flexible, scalable, and cost-effective manner. These characteristics have revolutionized IT service delivery and continue to drive the adoption and growth of cloud computing.
